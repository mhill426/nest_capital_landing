            <p>Eric has a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from the University of Dayton and holds his Series 3, 6, 7, 63, and 66 securities registrations and life insurance licenses. He is also a Series 24 Registered Principal. Eric’s work ethic and attention to detail have repeatedly earned him the Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network Premier Advisor1 distinction every year for 2007-2022, as well as recognition from Forbes as a Best-In-State Wealth Advisor2 for years 2018-2022. We strive to help clients live their best life, and in doing so over the years, we’ve assisted with and witnessed a clientele migration to all our country’s coastal regions along with plenty of places in between. Since our Team’s beginning in the early 1990’s, spending time with clients in their own homes or place of work has always been the cornerstone of our service commitment, and Eric continues that tradition by traveling all across the country to meet our elite clientele and their new neighbors they’ve been kind enough to refer to us. He feels that consistent effort and commitment to integrity have always been the building blocks for our solid base of clients, and it’s those referrals to client’s friends and family that validate that commitment. Eric also spearheads the group’s asset management due diligence by holding extensive meetings, interviews, and conference calls with senior management, market strategists, research analysts, mutual fund companies, and annuity firms. He works closely with Wells Fargo Advisors leaders and has served two 2-year terms on their Licensee Advisory Board of Independent Practices in 2012/2013 and again in 2020/2021.</p>
            <p>Eric is an Eagle Scout who enjoys and supports outdoor activities and programs, such at the 4Ocean Project. Living on Indian Lake in Russells Point, Ohio, affords Eric the opportunity, along with his wife, Kristen, and their daughters, Maribella and Madeline, to spend much of their free time out on the water—all things boating are family favorites.</p>
