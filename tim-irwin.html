            <p>Tim thoroughly enjoys his role as our Director of Development utilizing his 20-plus years of broad experience working in the financial services industry. Tim has been instrumental in expanding the business by helping create NEST Capital so other wealth management practices like KIG can join up and provide truly independent advice to clients. Prior to going to work for KIG and NEST Capital, Tim gained valuable experience through exciting roles in investment management, operations, trading, and leadership working for great firms such as Nationwide, Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan. He has a passion for helping people solve problems and realize their dreams through a collaborative and candid assessment of their specific situations and goals.</p>

            <p>Tim’s drive, in part, comes from watching his own father’s retirement experience. His dad was a pilot for a major airline for 35 years until he retired shortly after Tim went to work in financial services. When the airline filed for bankruptcy in the early 2000s, the pension was taken over and he received only 47% of his previously promised retirement package. Thanks to good planning, disciplined saving, and an independently-minded financial advisor, Tim’s parents were able to weather that financial storm and enjoy the retirement they always planned. Tim enjoys partnering with our own advisors and client service associates to get better together each day; and loves helping outside financial advisors reach their fullest potential through joining our independent, client-first practice.</p>

            <p>Tim earned his Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Colorado and earned his Certified Investment Management Analyst (CIMA®) designation from Cal-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. He also holds his FINRA Series 7, 63, and 65 securities registrations. Tim married the love of his life, Jane, in 2007.  They reside in Columbus, Ohio with their two incredible boys, Teddy and Sam, along with one dog, two cats, and a goldfish that defies nature. They enjoy spending leisure time together anywhere outdoors whether it be on a lake, in the woods, up in the mountains, or on the golf course.</p>
