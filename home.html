          <p>For decades advisors in the traditional employee-model firms have had limited choice in platforms for delivering unbiased, unfiltered advice, planning, and solutions to clients.  Wirehouse brokerage firm options were even more limited, especially if you were located outside of a major metro area.  Besides that, financial advisors were made to believe going independent was a bridge too far…that you would spend all your time hiring, firing, and paying utility bills instead of actually working with clients.  When you got into this business, you were likely told that this was your business and that you were running your own practice.  But the reality is that most broker/dealers look at your clients as their own; that clients work with an advisor because of the company on the business card.  And how about compensation plans?  Are they adjusted each year leaving you constantly pivoting?</p>

They say in real estate it’s “Location, Location, Location”. For me, as an advisor joining another practice, it was “Culture, Culture, Culture”. When I met with Lisa and Eric, it was clear that we shared the same priorities and philosophies for our clients and associates.
